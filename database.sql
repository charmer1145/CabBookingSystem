-- Note: We'll explicitly use user_id values by selecting them (but here we assume AUTO_INCREMENT order)
-- For robust scripts, you'd SELECT the ids; for simplicity we assume they are 1..10

-- Note: last feedback references booking 5 which was cancelled; driver_id might be NULL for cancelled bookings.

-- =========================
-- 3. Example Queries
-- =========================

-- 3.1 JOIN: List all bookings with customer name, driver name, pickup & drop area
SELECT
  b.booking_id,
  u_c.user_name AS customer_name,
  u_d.user_name AS driver_name,
  lp.area AS pickup_area,
  ld.area AS drop_area,
  b.ride_status,
  b.booking_amount
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN users u_c ON b.customer_id = u_c.user_id
LEFT JOIN users u_d ON b.driver_id = u_d.user_id
LEFT JOIN locations lp ON b.pickup_location_id = lp.location_id
LEFT JOIN locations ld ON b.drop_location_id = ld.location_id
ORDER BY b.booking_id;

-- 3.2 INNER JOIN with payments: Completed payments and rides
SELECT b.booking_id, u_c.user_name AS customer, p.amount, p.payment_status
FROM bookings b
JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
JOIN users u_c ON b.customer_id = u_c.user_id
WHERE p.payment_status = 'Completed';

-- 3.3 Subquery: Customers who have at least one ride with amount > 300
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_name
FROM users u
WHERE u.user_id IN (
    SELECT b.customer_id FROM bookings b
    JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
    WHERE p.amount > 300
);

-- 3.4 Aggregate: Total earnings (completed payments) by driver
SELECT u.user_name AS driver_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_earnings
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.driver_id
JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
WHERE p.payment_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY u.user_id
ORDER BY total_earnings DESC;

-- 3.5 Aggregates & HAVING: Drivers who earned more than 200
SELECT u.user_name AS driver_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_earnings
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.driver_id
JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
WHERE p.payment_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING SUM(p.amount) > 200;

-- 3.6 Nested subquery: Bookings where customer has rated driver 5 previously
SELECT b.booking_id, u.user_name AS customer
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.customer_id IN (
  SELECT f.customer_id FROM feedback f WHERE f.rating = 5
);

-- 3.7 Example of a correlated subquery: latest booking date for each customer
SELECT u.user_name, (
  SELECT MAX(b.date_of_booking) FROM bookings b WHERE b.customer_id = u.user_id
) AS last_booking_date
FROM users u
WHERE u.user_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customers);

-- =========================
-- 4. DML Examples (UPDATE / DELETE / INSERT)
-- =========================

-- 4.1 Update: mark payment 2 as completed after processing
UPDATE payments SET payment_status = 'Completed', processed_at = NOW() WHERE payment_id = 2;

-- 4.2 Update: set booking 2 status to Ongoing
UPDATE bookings SET ride_status = 'Ongoing' WHERE booking_id = 2;

-- 4.3 Insert: add a new booking (example)
INSERT INTO bookings (
    customer_id, driver_id, pickup_location_id, drop_location_id, date_of_booking, time_of_booking, eta, booking_amount, payment_method, ride_status, is_shared
) VALUES (1, 6, 3, 4, CURDATE(), '15:30:00', '00:40:00', 350.00, 'Card', 'Booked', FALSE);

-- 4.4 Delete: remove cancelled rides older than a certain date
DELETE FROM bookings WHERE ride_status = 'Cancelled' AND date_of_booking < '2025-01-01';

-- 4.5 Delete: delete a feedback (example)
DELETE FROM feedback WHERE feedback_id = 3;

-- =========================
-- 5. Useful SELECTS for checking data
-- =========================
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_users FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_drivers FROM drivers;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_bookings FROM bookings;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_payments FROM payments;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_feedback FROM feedback;
